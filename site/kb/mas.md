# Migration from the Mac App Store (MAS) edition

The last released version of PopClip on the Mac App Store is 2023.9. This
is the final update that will be available through the store.

If you have the MAS edition of PopClip, you can migrate for free to the
Standalone edition to continue receiving updates.

::: info From the developer

I apologise for the inconvenience of having to migrate away from the Mac App
Store. I wrote an explanation for why PopClip left the store in a
[forum post](https://forum.popclip.app/t/popclip-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/2188).
Thank you for your support and understanding. â€”Nick Moore, PopClip developer.

## How to migrate

1. Install PopClip 2023.9 from the MAS, if it is not installed
   already. _If you need to install it, you can find it in the Purchased section
   your account page in the MAS._
2. Run PopClip (MAS edition) once, then quit it.
3. Go to the /Applications folder in Finder and drag the PopClip app to the
   Trash.
4. Now download the latest version of PopClip (Standalone edition) from the
   [downloads](/download) page on this website.
5. Unzip the downloaded file and drag the new PopClip app to your /Applications
   folder.
6. Run the new PopClip app. It will detect your Mac App Store purchase and
   unlock itself.
