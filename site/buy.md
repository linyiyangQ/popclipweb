## Student Discount

Students can get a discount on a PopClip license key via
[Student App Centre](https://studentappcentre.com/app/popclip).

## Free

PopClip has a free trial mode which is fully functional. So if you just want to
try out PopClip, you can [download it](/download) and use every feature for
free.

After you have used 150 actions inside that app (and that usually takes a few
weeks of use), the app will start to nag you periodically to buy a license key.

If you have already used the free trial and you cannot afford PopClip,
[email me](/support), and I will send you a 1-year license for free.
