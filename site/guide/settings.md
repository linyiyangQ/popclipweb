# Settings

This page will give you a comprehensive overview of PopClip's settings.

## The settings menu

PopClip's settings menu is accessed by clicking the ![PopClip menu bar icon](./media/icon-status.png#icon) icon in the menu bar.

![](./media/shot-settings-general-2.png "PopClip menu bar icon and s  ettings menu.")

The settings menu has five panes:<br>[![Home icon](./media/icon-home.png#icon) Home](#home-pane), [![Options icon](./media/icon-options.png#icon) Options](#options-pane), [![Actions icon](./media/icon-exts.png#icon) Actions](#actions-pane), [![Excluded Apps icon](./media/icon-apps.png#icon) Excluded Apps](#excluded-apps-pane) and [![About icon](./media/icon-about.png#icon) About](#about-pane).

### Turn PopClip On and Off

The large button at the top showing **ON** and **OFF** controls whether PopClip appears automatically when you select text.

As a short-cut, you can also toggle PopClip on and off by secondary clicking (Right-click or Control-click) the PopClip icon in the menu bar.

On/off state can also be set with [AppleScript](/kb/applescript).

:::tip Still works when off!
Even when PopClip is turned off, you can use the [keyboard shortcut](./basics#activate-with-a-keyboard-shortcut) to make PopClip appear.

### App settings

- **Start at login:** When enabled, PopClip will start automatically when you log in to your Mac. *(Default: Off)*
- **Show in menu bar:** When disabled, the icon will be hidden from the menu bar. To show PopClip's settings when the icon is hidden, double-click the PopClip app in your Applications folder. *(Default: On)*
- **Check for updates** (Standalone edition only): When enabled, PopClip will check for updates automatically in the background. You can trigger an immediate update check by un-checking and re-checking this option. *(Default: On)*

:::tip Mac App Store and Setapp editions
If you have the Mac App Store or Setapp edition, you will not see the *Check for updates* option. Updates are managed by the Mac App Store or Setapp.

![](./media/shot-settings-options-3.png#pref "Options pane.")

### Appearance settings

- **Size:** Choose the size of the PopClip bar, with presets 1—4 from smallest to largest. *(Default: Size 2)*

- **Color:** Choose the color of the PopClip bar:
  - **Dark:** Dark appearance.
  - **Light:** Light appearance.
  - **Auto:** *(Default)* Automatically set dark or light appearance to match the system setting.
  - **Auto (Inverse):** Automatically set dark or light appearance opposite to the system setting.

:::details How to set the system dark/light mode
The system dark/light mode is controlled by the Appearance pane in System Settings. PopClip will also follow the system accent color for both the settings window and the PopClip bar.

![](./media/shot-system-appearance-1.png "Appearance pane in System Settings.")
:::

- **Position:** Choose where the PopClip bar should appear:
  - **Above:** *(Default)* Bar appears above the pointer.
  - **Below:** Bar appears below the pointer.

::: info Note on position

The above/below setting only applies when you select a single line of text. If the selection includes multiple lines, the bar will appear below the pointer if you made the selection by moving the mouse downwards, and above the selection if you made the selection by moving the mouse upwards. This is to avoid the bar obscuring the selection.

:::

### Keyboard Shortcut

Set a keyboard shortcut for making PopClip appear. See [Activate with a keyboard shortcut](./basics#activate-with-a-keyboard-shortcut) for details on using it.

- To set the keyboard shortcut, click the Record Shortcut button and then press the keys you want to use. The key combination must include at least one of the modifer keys ⌃, ⌥, and ⌘.

- To remove or change the keyboard shortcut, click the button and then press the new keys or click the 'X' button.

:::tip Choosing a keyboard shortcut
You can use any key combination you like, but it's good to pick somehting that's easy to remember and doesn't conflict with other common shortcuts. Personally, I use ⌃⌘P.
